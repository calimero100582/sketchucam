         <li><a id="a5a"><u>"Laser Control"</u></a> [checkbox] <i>New in 1.4a and updated in 1.4c</i>
            <p>Tick the Laser Control box on the parameters dialog and G-code will be output suitable for laser cutting on a machine that uses spindle commands to control the laser.
            <p>The current control scheme replaces all Z movements (start and end of cuts) with M03/M04 and M05 spindle motor on/off commands.
            <p>The M03/4 is combined with an S word giving PWM control of the laser power.
            <p>This value is set to the cut depth percentage of the current 'Spindle speed' set in the parameters dialog.

            <p>For example, if your controller accepts 10000rpm as the maximum spinde speed, then set that in the parameters dialog.</p>

               Now, for a 100% deep centerline cut, laser on command will be
               <dl><dd>    <b>M03 S10000</b> </dl>
               and a 50% deep centerline cut will be
               <dl><dd>    <b>M03 S5000</b> </dl>

            <p>If you are using GRBL 0.9 (and later) the default max spindle speed is 1000.</p>

            <p>If your laser only supports full on and full off and cannot use PWM, then always use 100% deep cuts 
               (and a correctly set maximum spindle speed as well) and the spindle control output will always be 
               either on or off.</p>

            <p><b>DO NOT</b> select 'ramping' nor 'Gen3D' when Laser Control is desired.<br>
            Ramping and Gen3D will be turned off automatically.</br>
            Multipass can be used to get cleaner edges in some materials. Experiment for yourself!</p>
            <p>Multipass in laser mode will use a constant power level.</p>

            <p><u>Plunge holes:</u> there are 2 modes: GRBL mode will draw a 0.2mm diam circle, not GRBL mode will create 
            a dot at the center of the hole. The length of the delay at this dot can be adjusted via the 
            Hole Feature Options dialog.<br>
            Large holes will draw a circle of the defined diameter (with no allowance for beam width). </p>
            
            <p>The display of the parameters dialog will change according to the laser mode selected:</p>
            <dl>
            <dt>If GRBL mode is 'false'
               <dd><img alt="laser 1 a" border=1 src="images/laser1a.png">
            <dt>If GRLB mode is 'true' and GRBL power mode is 'false'
               <dd><img alt="laser 2 a" border=1 src="images/laser2a.png">
            <dt>If GRLB mode is 'true' and GRBL power mode is 'true'
               <dd><img alt="laser 3 a" border=1 src="images/laser3a.png">
            </dl>
            

            <p>Summary:   </p>
               <ul>
               <li>works with both Z-Zero options
               <li>No Z motion will be in the Gcode output
               <li>M03 or M4(spindle on) and M05 (spindle off) will control the laser
               <li>The S word will be set to control the brightness via PWM spindle control.
               <li>The S word is set to a proportion of the current spindle speed, according to the depth of the cut.<br>
                  Thus a 50% deep centerline cut will set the S word to 50% of the spindle speed.
               <li>If your laser needs on/off control, then simply always use 100% deep cuts and max spindle speed (1000rpm for default GRBL settings).
                  With these settings the PWM control will effectively only turn hard on and hard off.
                  (also leave GRBL Power mode = false in hole feature options!)
               <li>See <A href="howto_options.html#a5a">Hole Feature Options</a> for an explanation of how the 
                  laser setting interacts with <b>GRBL's laser modes</b>.
               <li>Use normal tabs, not V-tabs.  Only half of a Vtab will be 'cut' at the defined power.
               </ul>
               
            <p>You can read more about GRBL's laser mode in the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gnea/grbl/blob/edge/doc/markdown/laser_mode.md">GRBL documentation</a></p>
         </ol>

         <p><u>Note</u>: When you press "OK", these settings will be saved as attributes to your
         sketchup model.  So each sketchup file will retain their individual settings.

         New in 1.1c is the ability to save and restore tool profiles.  
         This allows you to quickly restore a tool setup that relates to a type of material or operation.  
         For example one might store the settings for a drilling operation with multipass on, low feed speeds etc.
         For a foam milling tool one can store high feed speeds, not multipass and so on.<br>

         <b>Some points to note:</b>         
         <dl>
            <dt><A id="p1">Inside/Outside overcut%</a>
            <dd>This value is used as a multiplier on the material thickness.   
            The Phlatprinter is designed to cut through sheet material so normal cuts must go deeper than the material thickness.  
            This is normally about 140%, ie through the material and 40% out the other side to account for wavy dollar tree blue foam.   
            If you are using an overhead gantry and do not want to cut into your spoil board then set this value to 100% and zero your toolbit end accurately.

         You can hold down the <B>SHIFT</b> key when clicking, and you will be prompted for a <b>diameter</b>.<br>
         The hole will then be spiral bored to that diameter.  <br>
         This is a relatively slow way to cut a hole so holes that are greater than 3 times the diameter of the bit should rather be a circle with an inside cut to remove the waste.   
         However, if you are cutting soft material (large or no multipass) and using the 'diameter first' cut strategy, the cut will be quite quick.

            Only an <b>underlying horizontal line will interfere</b> but in this case it is very easy to delete the 
            part that overlaps the colored 'hole' line, or, you can group the underlying line before placing the holes. <br>
            Ordinary holes have no group name while enlarged holes are named with the diameter and depth. <br>
            For example a plain 8mm hole will be named "_diam_8.0mm" and a depth restricted 9mm hole will be "_diam_9.0mm_depth_76.0".<br>
            This implies that holes will be cut in group order so don't forget to set the order with the Group Reorder tool if you need to.

            ie for each stepover of the bit, it helical bored to final depth.<br>
            By setting the 'Use depth first or diam first' option to <b>false</b>, the 'spiral out' strategy will be used.
            This uses the following steps: (only for holes larger than 2 * bit_diameter!)
            <ol>
               <li>Helical bore the center hole to 2*bitdiameter
               <li>Spiral out to desired diameter using either multipass depth layers, or a fuzzy calculated depth based on the bit diameter.
            </ol>

         <b>CounterSink/CounterBore hole Tool</b> - (V1.4)
         This tool is used to create a plunge point WITH a CounterSINK or CounterBORE at any given cursor position.  
         <p>The example pictured at right was created using a 9mm straight flute bit.  The hole is 12mm diameter, 15mm deep, 
         and the countersink is 25mm diameter.
         The wood is unknown and resulted in fluffy edges, so what you see has been cleaned up by a few swipes with sandpaper.

         When you click the icon to select this tool, you will see a dialog box as pictured at right.<br>

         This permits you to set the values you want for your CounterSINK/BORE holes.<br>  
         These settings will be used for all future click events until you re-select the tool, or hold down SHIFT 
         to be prompted for a hole diameter (countersink/bore diameter and angle or depth will stay the same).
         </p>
         
            
         <h4>The Countersink tool</h4>
         <p><img alt="countersink tool" src="images/csink01.png" align=right >
         The <b>Countersink</b> tool creates a grouped symbol of 2 circles with a blue radius line extending from the center to the outside diameter of the inner circle.<br>
         The inner circle is the current bit diameter, or the hole diameter given in the dialog, which must be greater than the bit diameter.<br>
         The outer circle is 8 sided, coloured blue, and represents the diameter given for the countersink portion of the hole. 
         (yes, the countersink will be cut perfectly circular despite the octagonal symbol)<br>
         When setting the hole diameter, a diameter of 0.0 will use the current bit diameter.
         </p>
         <p>The step down for the countersink portion is 0.25mm per layer, with the decrease in radius being calculated from the
         angle selected in the dialog.  </p>
         <p>Common angles are 82 and 90 degrees, with 100 or 120 degrees being used in thin sheet metal applications.
         Use the one that matches your screws! Angle is limited to >= 70 and < 180 degrees.

         <h4>The <b>CounterBORE</b> tool</h4>
         By selecting <b>CounterBore</b> from the first drop down list the tool will create counterbore operations, making a symbol as shown at right, showing the center hole diameter as for the countersink tool, and the outer diameter shown as a 9 sided figure in green.  
         The radius indicator line will be green.<br>
         The angle setting is ignored, and the 'Set Depth' setting is used for the depth of the counterbore.  
         This is set using the current model units.
         Optionally set the 'Hole Diameter' to have a full depth hole that is bigger than the bit diameter.  
         Set to 0 to have a plain bit diameter hole.
         <ul>
         <li>Counterbore depth cannot be greater than the current <i>Material Thickness.</i>
         <li>Hole Diameter cannot be larger than <i>Countersink/bore diameter.</i>
         </ul>
         
         <b>Things that apply to both options:</b><br>
         
         <p>The hole depth is ALWAYS 'overcut%' deep, you cannot specify a shallower depth.  
         This is because the  countersink/bore portion has to have a central hole of at least bit_diameter to start from that is guaranteed to be deeper than the bottom end of the countersink or counterbore depth.
         </p>
         <p>
         You can hold down the SHIFT key when clicking, and you will be prompted for a diameter.
         The hole will then be spiral bored to that diameter before the countersink/bore is created.  
         </p>
         
         <p>Hold down ALT or CTRL key to be prompted for a grid pattern of holes to drill.  
         They will all use the same parameters.</p>
         
         Feedrate will be the normal rate set for cuts.<br>
         Downfeed will be limited to either (and will use fuzzy calculation)
         <ul>
         <li>Half the bit diameter per revolution.</li>
         <li>The multipass depth if multipass is on.</li>
         </ul>
         Notes:
         <ol class="newcolour">
         <li>Note that the various CNC controllers will perform this operation in different ways.
         LinuxCNC will do true spiral descending cuts, while other controllers might step down 
         and do a circle with constant Z instead.
         <li>While the hole boring part will obey the Use_plunge_CW setting, the countersink portion
         can only cut counterclockwise and always uses the 'spiral out' strategy.

         <b>Pocket Tool</b> - This tool is used to create a pocket inside a shape.

         <p>A pocket is a shallow depression in the surface of the part.</p>  
         
         <p>As of V1.4c this tool has 2 modes:</p>
         <dl style="margin-left: 20px;">
         <dt>Default mode</dt>

            <dd>This mode is for pocketing complex polygons that may have internal holes, however, processing takes much longer.</dd>

         <h4>Default mode</h4>
         <div style="margin-left: 30px;">
            This mode will add both a contour outline and the zigzag with one mouse click.

            The following control keys can be used:

               <dt>CTRL</dt>   
                  <dd>Hold down control to insert only the contour outline.  This gives you the opportunity to check (and fix) the contour

            While this mode can deal with more complicated polygons, using it is also a bit more complicated so please note the following:<br>
            This is a 2 stage process, you will need to hold CTRL and insert the contours (left click), then point at the new face created
            and left click again (without CTRL) to insert the zigzags.
            
            <p>Fuzzy stepover is always used in FLOOD mode.</p>

                  <dd>Hold down control to insert only the contour outline.  This gives you the opportunity to check (and fix) the contour

         <p><b>Note:</b>  You can type custom depth values into the VCB, using your keyboard (in addition to using the arrow keys to select a depth).  
         The value is <b>not accepted, until the "Enter" key</b>
         is pressed.  Then the % suffix will appear with the VCB value, which indicates the value is now set.  Max value allowed is 99%.
         &nbsp;</p>
         <p><b>Fuzzy stepover (new in V1.3a)</b><br>
         <div style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <p>The pocket zigzag can use either the exact stepover% set in the parameters dialog, or it can use 'fuzzy stepover'.</p>
            
            <p>Using the exact stepover may result in a gap at the end of the zigzag that is much larger than the stepover%, causing the final outline cut to remove a chunk of material that is near to bit diameter.  
            This could break the bit in harder materials.</p>
            
            <p>The option 'Use fuzzy pockets' defaults to ON since this results in a safer, optimal, zigzag spacing. 
            You can change this setting on the Tools|Phlatboyz|Options|Features menu</p>
            
            <p>The stepover is recalculated such that there is no remainder at the end of the zigzag, making the final cut the same width as the first cut.
            (This may vary for complex shapes, use a smaller stepover for complex shapes, and change zigzag direction to find the best fill).</p>
            
            <p>The stepover is calculated as a SMALLER value if stepover% is less than 50%.
            It is calculated as a larger value if stepover% is LARGER than 50%.
            if stepover% is exactly 50% is uses that value.   According to tool manufacturers using a 50% tool stepover will significantly shorten tool life so
            you should never use this anyway.  </p>
            
            <p>The <b>offset</b> from the bounding rectangle to the zigzag edges is calculated from the stepover% as follows:</p>
            <pre>stepover% &lt; 75%
   offset = stepover% / 2
stepover% &lt; 85%
   offset =  stepover% / 3 
stepover% &lt;= 100%
   offset =  stepover% / 4</pre>
            <p>This means that the offset is adjusted smaller as the stepover increases.  
            This is done to prevent leaving large wedges for the final cut to handle, this happens especially on curved or sloped edges.
            Note that in FLOOD mode the zigzag will approach very close to the contour lines in places.  This is normal.
            </p>
         </div>
            
         <h4>MultiSelect pocketing (new in v1.4)</h4>
         <ul>
         <li>If multiple faces are selected when the pocket tool is selected, all the faces will be pocketed
         <li>All selected entities will be UNselected after this process
         <li>If only one thing is selected, nothing is done, process is ignored
         <li> Make sure you have the correct pocket parameters before doing the multiselect operation!   
               (this works for FLOOD mode as well, select flood mode then select multiple faces, 
               then when you select the pocket tool again it will zigzag all selected faces.)

<b>Generate G-code</b> - This tool is the last step in the SketchUcam process. Once
the parts are surrounded by safe cutting area and all cut lines and
tabs have been assigned, click on this icon to open a file save
dialogue box to save your g-code file to the location you specify. <br><br>
The SketchUcam will calculate the optimal cut order.  Or you can choose your own cut order.
You do this by grouping your parts and they will be cut in the same order.
<br><br>
Note:
The output g-code file has the extension .cnc but is simply a text file
of X, Y, Z coordinates for the Phlatboyz machine to follow. Depending
on your control software, this extension can be renamed to anything
desired. To edit the g-code file, you can right click and open with a
text editor of your choice. If you alter this file, your machine may 
do unexpected things, be very careful! &nbsp; </td>
