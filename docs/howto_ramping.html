<p>
With the advent of stronger home CNC routers (and mills) 
like the Shapeoko and OX, comes the desire to cut harder 
materials like G10 and aluminum.
The right way to enter cuts in such materials is to ramp 
in at an angle until the cutter reaches the correct depth.<br>
With this release (1.3, May 2015) SketchUcam brings you 
simple ramping options that increase your work envelope 
in harder materials.
Of course, the previous option of plunging directly into 
the work is still available.
</p>


<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plunges are replaced with ramps.
<li>Arcs and lines can be ramped.
<li>Plunge feed rate is used for ramps.
<li>Plunge bores use the ramp angle for the helix.
<li>Segments less than BitRadius long will not be ramped.
<li>On lines longer than 5 x bitdiameter the ramp length will be limited to 5 x bitdiameter. <span style="color: red;">(new in V1.5)</span>
</ul>

<h3>Basics</h3>

<p>With ramping turned on, any point that would have been a 
plunge becomes a ramp along the first segment of the cut, 
and also after tabs, 
as you can see in the image at above right.
The cut begins at the closest corner to the origin and 
ramps along the first segment, taking two passes to get 
to full depth.  In this case the ramp angle
limit is 5 degrees. 
</p>
<p>If the first segment of a cut is very short, less than BitDiam/2, the cut will be converted to a <b>vertical plunge</b>.  
A comment will be inserted in the code saying <br><br>
<code>
<b>(ramplimit end, translated to plunge) </b><br>
</code><br>
<i style="font-size: larger;">Again we emphasize the need to preview the G-code before cutting, especially if the bit has limited plunge capability 
(in which case a possible solution is to do a drawing with plunge holes at all start points and use an actual drill bit to
pre-drill all those holes).</i>

</p>

<div style="float: right; width: 409px; border: 2px solid gray;">
<img src="images/ramp04.png">
<div>Ramping on an arc, 20 degree limit, 10mm deep, 12 segments in arc</div>
</div>
If the first segment is an arc (or a tab on an arc), 
the arc will be ramped to depth.  Some controllers will 
not cut a proper helix, instead plunging and then cutting 
the arc, despite the G-code specifying a helical 
(ramped arc) motion. (You will already know this for 
your controller since plunge holes with larger than 
bit diameter use helical arcs to get to the desired 
diameter).
<p>
When  placing arcs it might be better to use 8 or 12 segments instead of the default 24, 
this makes each segment longer giving it a decent chance to ramp.
</p>
<p>
The 'plunge rate' feed speed is used for all ramp movements.   <br>
This can be the same as the Feed speed, or less, depending on the capabilities of your tool bit and machine strength.

<p>
There are two modes of operation, with and without <b>ramp angle limiting</b>.</p>
<ol>
<li>With the ramp angle set to 0 degrees, the angle is not 
limited.  This means that depth will always be reached 
in a single zigzag.
For a short segment the 'ramp' could be almost vertical 
so it is important to study the G-code in a previewer 
before cutting to ensure that the angles are sensible.   
However, ramping on arcs will be limited to 45 degrees 
even when limit is set to 0.
<li>
With the ramp angle limit set from 1 to 45 degrees the actual cut angle is always less than or equal to the given angle.
As many ramp movements as are needed to get to depth at the angle given will be generated.
The number of ramps must always be an even number so the count is rounded up, thus reducing the angle slightly in many cases.
</ol>
<hr>
<p><img src="images/ramp02.png" style="float: right; border: 2px solid gray">
The ramp options are set on the <a href="sketchucamtoolbar.html#toolparameters">parameters dialog</a>, a segment of which is shown at right.
Tick 'Ramp in Z' to turn ramping on.<br>
Set the 'Ramp angle limit' to 0 for no limit, or to a value from 1 to 45 degrees for a limited angle.<br>
Note that small angle limits may significantly increase your cut time.
</p>

<h3>Shortening long ramps:</h3>
<img src="images/ramp05.png" style="float: right;">
<p>The old technique below is no longer needed since all ramps are now limited to 
5 x bitdiameter in length if the segment is longer than that figure.
</p>
<p style="color: gray;">
If the first segment of a cut is a very long straight line 
the ramp will be very long.
You can shorten it by placing a <b>tab</b> 
a suitable distance along that line, and then use the PB 
erase tool to remove the tab.
The cut line will remain 'broken' at that point and the 
ramp will only go up to the break, as illustrated at right.
In that drawing is an outside cut around a 100x30mm 
rectangle, the long cuts are just over 100mm, and the 
ramp is about 20mm long to a depth of 10mm.
</p>
It will ramp down after tabs, with the added optimization of plunging down to almost 
(less a few thou) the previous pass depth before starting the new ramp.


<h3>Multipass ramps:</h3>
<p>
Multipass ramping has been optimized by allowing the tool to rapid down to the previous pass level after tabs, 
before beginning the new ramp.  
The rapid will stop 0.25mm above the previous pass depth.  If the multipass depth is less than 0.25mm
then passdepth/2 is used as the hold off height.
</p>
<img src="images/ramp06.png">
<p>
In the image at above you can see that the first pass is deeper than the tab so it ramps from the top of the tab down to the
pass depth.</p>

<p>On the second pass it rapids (the vertical blue line) down to pass height less 0.25 before starting the ramp down to final depth.</p>

<h3>V-tabs:</h3>
<p>If you use a 'normal' V-tab the angles may be much higher than the limit angle for your toolbit.  To make it easy to 
find a V-tab width that preserves the ramp angle limit, a tool has been added to the <a href="toolsmenu.html#rvtab"><b>Tools|Phlatboyz</b></a> menu.
To use it:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Parameters dialog, set your tab depth, shallow tabs are recommended otherwise the tabs can be very long, 
   start at 75% depth (which leaves 25% of material thickness behind).
<li>Set the ramp angle limit
<li>Close the Parameters dialog
<li>Pick 'Set Ramp Vtabs' on the Tools|Phlatboyz menu.
<li>Open the Parameters dialog and you will see that the tab width and depth have been changed.
</ol>
<p>
These values will preserve the selected ramp angle through V-tabs, and also preserve the actual V-tab height. (V-tabs
usually come out a little thinner than the set value, due to the geometry of the bit traversing the peak of the V, 
smaller bits will remove less than larger bits.)
</p>
<p>
It is best to use <b>normal tabs on arcs</b>, Vtabs can easily be too short to maintain the 
limited ramp angle.  Might not matter on plywood, but will matter on aluminum and on angle limited cutter types.
</p>

<h3>Ramping and plunge holes</h3>
<p>
<img src="images/ramp10.png" style="float: right;">
The helix angle used for boring holes will be limited to the ramp angle if it is set &gt; 0.
If not set the normal scheme is used, ie each helix depth will be limited to multipassdepth or to BitDiam/2 if multipass is off.
Limiting the helix angle means that the number of cuts will vary with diameter, requiring more cuts for the inside of a hole
than for the final diameter cuts.  This is particularly noticeable at low ramp limit angles.
</p>
<p>
When ramping is on the plunge hole routine will try hard to <i>not plunge</i> directly into the work.
Obviously, if the plunge hole is the same diameter as the toolbit, it will have to plunge.<br>
 In this case it may be better to do a seperate drawing with just these holes on it, and generate G-code with either:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multipass set to a much smaller multipass depth than would be used for the normal cuts<br>
or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normal multipass depth, but use a real drill bit for the cuts, and run this file before the normal cut file (see <a href="toolsmenu.html">G-code joiner</a>).
</p>
<p>For holes with <b>diameter larger than the toolbit</b>, plunging the center hole will be <b>avoided</b> as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
   <p>For holes <b>less than 2xBitDiam</b> it will use the setting of the 'Stepover%' to decide whether or not to do an initial
   bore of the center before is does the finishing pass.
   </p>
   <dl>
   <dt>Stepover% < 50%   <img src="images/ramp08.png" style="float: right;">
         <dd>do an initial helical bore of 70% of final hole size, use this for hard materials (metals)
         <br clear=all>
   <dt>Stepover% >= 50%      <img src="images/ramp07.png" style="float: right;">
      <dd> skip the initial bore and just do the finished hole size pass, you might use this for not so hard materials like G10
   </dl>
<br clear=all>
   
<div style="float: right; width: 340px; border: 2px solid gray;">
<img src="images/ramp09.png">
<div>Ramp limit 5 degrees.<br>Bit diameter 5mm.<br>Hole size 19mm.<br>Stepover 25%</div>
</div>
   <p>
   For holes <b>greater than 2x BitDiam</b> it will always helical bore an initial hole with offset of BitDiam/2.
   This bores a hole 2 x BitDiam and clears the center without plunging.
   </p>
   <p>Keep in mind that the Stepover% will also be used to set the stepover of the bit for each helical pass.
   </p>
